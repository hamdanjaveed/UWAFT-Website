<!-- Website requirements (taken from the facebook page, see:https://www.facebook.com/groups/591982934192138/permalink/592857804104651/)

Problems with the old website:
    - looks horrible
    - boring
    - generic

The solution needs to:
    - be unique
    - think auto manufacturer
        > http://www.teslamotors.com
        > http://www.ds5.citroen.com

Requirements:
    - land on uwaft.com and see cars
    - market the current vehicle (Malibu)
    - showcase the older cars as well
    - for each vehicle we need to show:
        > pictures
        > features
        > specs
        > architecture
    - have a page to show the lab, facility and other pictures
    - have a page to show the team, the categories are:
        > engineering
            - core
            - co-op
            - 4th year
        > business
        > communications
    - a test drive button
    - a place to play mini-games

                Our re-engineered Malibu has two 140 HP electric motors, along with an engine able to run on up to 85% ethanol. When your charge becomes too low, it'll turn on to keep you driving. The best part? If you never drop below 20%, then you'll never use a drop of gas.

                "At UWAFT, we're changing the way people drive. Imagine a car that adapts to how you drive, rather than you having to adapt to your car. We're working hard to make that a reality.

                     "Working with UWAFT provided me with some great opportunities near the end of my undergraduate degree. Working on the marketing side of the Outreach Team I was able to attend different conferences and workshop and even had the opportunity to meet David Suzuki ... UWAFT really provides students with a number of learning opportunities where you can dictate your own success by the work you put it."
